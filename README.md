# C Data Structures And Algorithms
Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output. Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.
From the data structure point of view, following are some important categories of algorithms −

* Search − Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.
* Sort − Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.
* Insert − Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.
* Update − Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.
* Delete − Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.

## Types Of Data Structures And Algorithms

1. **Linked List**

A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.
Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link.
Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array.
Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.

Link − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.
Next − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.
Linked List − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.

### Types Of Linked List
	* Single Linked List

## Sort Algorithm
- Elementary sorts : selection sort, insertion sort and bubble sort
- Shellsort
